{"prompts": ["Task: Strings should not be concatenated using '+' in a loop\n\nQ: Why is string concatenation using '+' in a loop problematic? \nA: Strings in Java are immutable, meaning each concatenation with '+' creates a new string object. In a loop, this results in multiple new objects being created, copied, and discarded, which is computationally expensive and scales poorly with string length or loop iterations.\n\nQ: What is the performance impact of this approach? \nA: Each iteration creates an intermediate string object, copies the existing string, appends the new part, and converts it back to a string. This leads to O(n\u00b2) time complexity for concatenating n strings, as the cost of copying grows with the string's length, potentially causing significant performance issues, especially with large arrays or attacker-controlled inputs.\n\nQ: What is a better alternative to string concatenation in a loop? \nA: Using StringBuilder is more efficient because it maintains a mutable buffer, allowing appends without creating new objects each time. StringBuilder has O(n) time complexity for appending n strings, as it avoids repeated copying and object creation.\n\nQ: How should the code be rewritten to address this issue? \\\nA: Replace the string concatenation with StringBuilder. Initialize a StringBuilder object, append each string in the loop using the append() method, and convert the final result to a string using toString().\n\nCode:\n\n    public static String generateFibonacciString(int numRepetitions) {\n        String result = \\\"\\\";\n        int a = 0, b = 1;\n        for (int x = 0; x < numRepetitions; x++) {\n            result += a + (x < numRepetitions - 1 ? \\\", \\\" : \\\"\\\");\n            int next = a + b;\n            a = b;\n            b = next;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n"]}
